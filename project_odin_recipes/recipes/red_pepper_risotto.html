  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>40g cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>32g tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 pepper</li>
    <li>25g red chilli relish</li>
    <li>30g pine nut & seed mix</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground turmeric</li>
    <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
    <li>15ml Chinese rice wine</li>
    <li>11g vegetable stock mix</li>
    <li>160g arborio rice</li>
    <li>5g chives</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
    <li>1 red onion</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Method</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180°C/ 160°C (fan)/ gas 6 

      Deseed the peppers (scrape the seeds and pith out with a teaspoon) and cut into thin strips
      
      Add the pepper strips to a baking tray with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt
      
      Put the tray in the oven for 20-25 min until roasted and golden – these are your roasted peppers</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, boil a full kettle

      Peel and finely dice the red onion[s]
      
      Dissolve the vegetable stock mix in 700ml [1.4L] boiled water, then add the tomato paste, Chinese rice wine and chilli relish – this is your sweet tomato stock</li>
    <li>Heat a large, wide-based pan (preferably non-stick) with a drizzle of olive oil and a knob of butter over a medium heat

      Once hot, add the diced onion with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 min until softened but not browned
      
      Meanwhile, peel and finely chop (or grate) the garlic</li>
    <li>Once the onion has softened, add the arborio rice, chopped garlic, smoked paprika and ground turmeric to the pan and cook for 1 min further</li>
    <li>Add 1/3 of the sweet tomato stock and stir continuously until absorbed

      Continue to add the remaining sweet tomato stock, a ladle at a time, stirring continuously for 25-30 min, until all the stock has absorbed and the rice is cooked – this is your risotto</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, chop the chives finely

      Grate the cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>Once cooked, remove the roasted pepper from the oven

      Stir half of the roasted pepper into the risotto (you'll use the rest later!)
      
      Remove the risotto from the heat and stir in half of the grated cheese and half of the chopped chives (save the rest for garnish!), then season with a grind of black pepper – this is your sweet mixed pepper & chive risotto
      
      To serve, top the sweet mixed pepper & chive risotto with the reserved roasted pepper, remaining grated cheese and the pine nut & seed mix
      
      Garnish with the reserved chopped chives and a drizzle of olive oil
      
      Enjoy!</li>
