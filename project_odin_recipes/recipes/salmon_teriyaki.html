  <p>Teriyaki salmon is a dish made by marinating salmon fillets in a sweet and savory mixture of soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar, and then grilling, broiling, or baking until cooked through. The marinade creates a delicious glaze that caramelizes on the surface of the salmon, giving it a sweet and slightly charred flavor. Teriyaki salmon is a popular Japanese-inspired dish that is often served with rice and vegetables, and can be enjoyed as a healthy and flavorful meal.</p>
